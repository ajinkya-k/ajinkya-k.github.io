I am pursuing research in causal inference, machine learning and decision-making. Currently, my work focuses on heterogeneous treatment effect estimation, and causal inference for social networks. Prior to joining UW—Madison, I graduated with a MS in Economics and Computation at Duke University (2020). I got my undergraduate dual-degree in Computer Science and Economics from Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani in India."
