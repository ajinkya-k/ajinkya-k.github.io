    "text": "Books\nI read a lot, with occasional droughts. My Goodreads profile, which can be found here, is reasonably up to date.\n\nWhere to get books?\n\nLibraries\nI love libraries! I frequently use the University of Wisconsin–Madison libraries and the Middleton Public Library. Both have a vast collection of audiobooks and eBooks that are made available through Libby. If you live in the US, chances are your local library provides eBooks and audiobooks through Libby. The Middleton Public Library also provides audiobooks and eBooks via Hoopla Digital. In fact the local library near you may even offer free access to movies, TV shows and documentaries through Kanopy.\n\n\nBuying Physical Books\nIf you want to buy physical copies, I highly recommend BookFinder. Its a search engine that collates a list of online stores where the book you want is available sorted by price (and categorized by used/new). It is perhaps the best way to find the cheapest copy of a book available for sale online."

However, this abstraction also makes it difficult to understand the concepts in measure theory. The following are a few interactive demos I made for myself to understand measure theory. They are incomplete and I have added little exposition if any. I plan to update them sometime in the future.\nConvergence of Random Variables demo Lebesgue Integral demo"
