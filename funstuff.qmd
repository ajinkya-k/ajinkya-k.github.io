## Podcasts

The majority of my free time is spent reading something or listening to something.

## Books

I read a lot, with occasional droughts. My Goodreads profile, 
which can be found [here](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16471733-ajinkya-kokandakar), 
is reasonably up to date.

### Where to get books?

#### Libraries

I love libraries! I frequently use the [University of Wisconsin--Madison libraries](https://www.library.wisc.edu/) and the [Middleton Public Library](https://www.midlibrary.org/).
Both have a vast collection of audiobooks and eBooks that are made available through [Libby](https://libbyapp.com/).
If you live in the US, chances are your local library provides eBooks and audiobooks through Libby.
The Middleton Public Library also provides audiobooks and eBooks via [Hoopla Digital](https://www.hoopladigital.com/).
In fact the local library near you may even offer free access to movies, TV shows and documentaries through [Kanopy](https://www.kanopy.com/en/signup).


#### Buying Physical Books

If you want to buy physical copies, I highly recommend [BookFinder](https://www.bookfinder.com/). Its a search engine that collates a list of online stores where the book you want is available sorted by price (and categorized by used/new).
It is perhaps the best way to find the cheapest copy of a book available for sale online.
