## Statistics related open source code
In addition to writing software for my own research, I regularly contribute to open source projects related to statistics, especially in the `Julia` programming language ecosystem.
So far I have contributed to the following packages:

- [Julia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aajinkya-k+) language documentation
- [LinearAlgebra.jl](https://github.com/JuliaLang/LinearAlgebra.jl/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aajinkya-k+)
- [Statistics.jl](https://github.com/JuliaStats/Statistics.jl/pulls?q=is:pr+author:ajinkya-k+)
- [MixedModels.jl](https://github.com/JuliaStats/MixedModels.jl/pulls?q=is:pr+author:ajinkya-k+)
- [GLM.jl](https://github.com/JuliaStats/GLM.jl/pulls?q=is:pr+author:ajinkya-k+)
- [PrettyChairmarks.jl](https://github.com/astrozot/PrettyChairmarks.jl/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aajinkya-k+)

I have also contributed to the `R` language [documentation](https://github.com/r-devel/r-dev-day/issues/79) and submitted bug-fixes to other `R` packages (see [1](https://github.com/almost-matching-exactly/MALTS/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aajinkya-k+), [2](https://github.com/vittorioorlandi/drbart/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aajinkya-k+)).

All GitHub PRs [here](https://github.com/search?q=author%3Aajinkya-k+&type=pullrequests&s=created&o=desc).


## Rust projects

- [`latex-clean-rs`](https://github.com/ajinkya-k/latex-clean-rs): a command line tool to clean (la)tex-generated auxiliary files
- [`branchtransfer`](https://github.com/ajinkya-k/branchtransfer): a command line tool to transfer files from a git repo's working directory to another branch
- [`pretty-speedtest-rs`](https://github.com/ajinkya-k/pretty-speedtest-rs) which is basically just a fork of [speedtest-rs](https://github.com/nelsonjchen/speedtest-rs)
