**Ajinkya Kokandakar**
<br/>Graduate Student (Ph.D. Statistics)

I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Statistics at The University of Wisconsin—Madison advised by [Dr. Sameer Deshpande](https://skdeshpande91.github.io/). I am pursuing research in causal inference, machine learning and decision-making. Currently, my work focuses on heterogeneous treatment effect estimation, and causal inference for social networks. Prior to joining UW—Madison, I graduated with a MS in Economics and Computation at Duke University (2020). I got my undergraduate dual-degree in Computer Science and Economics from Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani in India.
