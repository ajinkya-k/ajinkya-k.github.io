## Ajinkya Kokandakar

Ph.D. Candidate in Statistics | Statistical Consultant
<br/>The University of Wisconsin--Madison
<br/>[ajinkya@stat.wisc.edu](mailto:ajinkya@stat.wisc.edu)

**Current:** I am working as a Data Science Intern at [Mathematica Inc](https://www.mathematica.org) (Summer 2024).

**Research:** I am a Ph.D. candidate in Statistics at the UW-Madison advised by [Dr. Sameer Deshpande](https://skdeshpande91.github.io/), pursuing research in causal inference and Bayesian methods.
Currently, my work focuses on heterogeneous treatment effect estimation, and causal inference when the exposure is not very well defined. 

**Consulting:** I work as a consultant in the [Statistical Consulting Group](https://stat.wisc.edu/statistical-consulting-team/) at UW-Madison (formerly the CALS Consulting Lab), assisting clients from life sciences with experimental design and data analysis.

**Background:** Prior to joining UWâ€”Madison, I graduated with a MS in Economics and Computation at Duke University (2020). I got my undergraduate dual-degree in Computer Science and Economics from Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani in India.
