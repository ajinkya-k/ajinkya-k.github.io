    # Library of Explantations


    The internet is full of amazing explanations for all sorts of concepts. 
    The following link is a running list of explanations that I found very insightful. 
    Each author is tagged in the explanation and all credit belongs to the author cited. 
    I have tried my best to credit every author for a page, but if I have missed someone: 
    (a) I apologize and 
    (b) let me know so I can correct that.

    [Library of Explanations!](https://www.notion.so/ajinkya/865585f2c2e94843a4a530e0bebf0df8?v=4c769956720049dd9d6f688f56bf3e38)

    **Disclaimer:** While visualizations are a good hook for getting people 
    interested in mathematics, they should not be used as the sole learning tool. 
    Do read [this essay](https://j2kun.svbtle.com/why-i-hate-and-love-visualizations-of-mathematics) that talks about the possibilities and limitations of visual explainers. 

    # Textbooks and References
    The following is a list of textbooks and references that I have found to be helpful, 
    many of which are freely available.

    # Visualizing Measure Theory
    The level of abstraction provided by measure theory is the reason why it is 
    a powerful and general tool for proving results in mathematics. 
    However, this abstraction also makes it difficult to understand the concepts in measure theory. 
    The following are a few interactive demos I made for myself to understand measure theory. 
    They are incomplete and I have added little exposition if any. I plan to update them sometime in the future.
