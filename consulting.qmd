I work as a Project Assistant in the [Statistical Consulting Group](https://stat.wisc.edu/statistical-consulting/) which is a part of the Department of Statistics at the University of Wisconsin--Madison.
As a consultant, I have worked with more than 20 clients helping them with experimental design, data analysis and conveying statistical results.
