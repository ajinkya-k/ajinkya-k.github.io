I work as a Project Assistant in the [Statistical Consulting Group](https://stat.wisc.edu/statistical-consulting/) which is a part of the Department of Statistics at the University of Wisconsin--Madison.
As a consultant, I have worked with more than 20 clients helping them with experimental design, data analysis and conveying statistical results.
Some of our work has been highlighted in this [article](https://stat.wisc.edu/2025/02/05/on-the-cutting-edge-statistical-consulting-group-enhances-diverse-research-projects-across-uw-madison-campus/).
